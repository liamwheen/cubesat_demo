To run the program:
  python run_orbit.py
  
To use the program:
  Drag the sphere to your desired orientation in order to place the target for the CubeSat
  Double click a spot on the sphere and watch as the satellite's camera (traced by the black line) converges to it
  - The top left animation shows the torque vector created by the wheels within the CubeSat, these are what turn the CubeSat in space
  - The top right plot shows the absolute error from where the CubeSat is currently pointing to the target
  - The bottom right plot shows the directed speeds of the three perpendicular wheels acting within the CubeSat
  
At any point, double click to replace the position of the target
